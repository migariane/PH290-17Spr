<blockquote>
<p><strong>note</strong></p>

<p>The content of this tutorial was adapted from Berkeley Statistics Department's <a href="https://github.com/berkeley-scf/tutorial-git-basics">Git Basics Tutorial</a>, and Fernando Pérez' <a href="https://github.com/fperez/reprosw/blob/master/Version%20Control.ipynb">Lecture
notes (in IPython Notebook format) on Reproducible Science And Modern
Scientific
Software</a>.</p>

<p>Before reading this, you will want to be familiar with the material in
the "Basics of UNIX" tutorial and screencast here:
<a href="http://statistics.berkeley.edu/computing/training/tutorials">http://statistics.berkeley.edu/computing/training/tutorials</a></p>

<p>In this tutorial, I will use a <code>$</code> prompt for bash. To follow along,
you will need to have bash and <code>git</code> installed on your computer. If
you are using the BCE VM, you should have everything you need
installed.</p>

<p>If you don't have git installed, please see
<a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">this</a>
for help.</p>

<p>You will also need a GitHub account to follow some of the examples
using git remotes. If you don't already have one, create a educational GitHub
account <a href="https://github.com/join">here</a>.</p>

<h2>
<a id="user-content-what-is-version-control" class="anchor" href="#what-is-version-control" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is version control?</h2>

<p>As a statistician, scientist, or engineer, you will work on projects
that include code, data, and text. For trivially small and short-lived
projects, it may suffice to keep track of the various files mentally. As
the size and duration of your project grows, you will eventually need to
adopt a system to track everything.</p>

<p>Consider the following example:</p>

<pre><code>$ tree proj1
proj1
├── code
│   ├── analysis.py
│   ├── eda.py
│   └── preprocess.py
├── data
│   └── blob.dat
├── figs
│   └── diagram.png
├── paper
│   ├── Makefile
│   ├── report.bib
│   └── report.tex
└── slides
    └── presentation.md

5 directories, 9 files
</code></pre>

<p>Above I've displayed the directory tree for a project. Now suppose that
I have an idea about an alternative analysis to the one currently
implemented in <code>proj1/code/analysis.py</code>. I could manually backup the
current analysis script doing something like
<code>cp analysis.py analysis.py.orig</code>. And then start implementing the new
analysis in <code>analysis.py</code>. While I am still trying to debug my new
analysis script, my advisor suggests a third alternative approach, so
now I create a third version <code>analysis-advisor.py</code>. The new analysis
methods each require that I conduct different preprocessing steps, so
now I create the following new files: <code>preprocess-new.py</code> and
<code>preprocess-advisor.py</code>. Now I just need to remember that
<code>preprocess-new.py</code> goes with <code>analysis.py</code>, <code>preprocess.py</code> goes with
<code>analysis.py.orig</code>, and <code>preprocess-advisor.py</code> goes with
<code>analysis-advisor.py</code>.</p>

<p>It is easy to further complicate this example. For instance, what if you
are working on this project with several colleagues. Each member will
want their own copy of the project and you will need a mechanism to
share the files with one another. You might consider sharing the project
using something like Dropbox. However, this will require care as it can
be difficult to determine which changes will be synced when two people
edit the same file at the same time.</p>

<p>Instead of manually trying to keep track of the changes you've made to
code, data, and documents as indicated above, version control software
helps you automate and manage this process. This has several benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>  allowing you to easily go back to earlier versions;</li>
<li>  allowing you to have multiple version you can switch between;</li>
<li>  allowing you to easily separate tentative new directions into
different branches of work, which you can later discard or merge
back into your main line of development;</li>
<li>  allowing you to share work easily without worrying about conflicts;
and</li>
<li>  providing built-in backup.</li>
</ul>

<p>To see how this works, we will now consider the basic operation of a
popular and powerful version control system (VCS) called Git. First, we
will need to develop some basic vocabulary needed to discuss how Git
works. Then we will see how to use Git locally as a single-user using a
linear workflow. We will then see how to use branches rather than
following a simple linear workflow. Finally, we will discuss using
remotes instead of just working locally including a short discussion of
collaborative development with one shared remote.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>note</strong></p>

<p>VCS come in two main architectures: client-server (e.g., CVS,
Subversion) and distributed (e.g., Mercurial, <strong>Git</strong>). In the
client-server architecture, there is one master repository and
everyone working on the repository has their own minimal local copy of
the master repository. In the distributed model, every repository is a
complete repository and there are mechanisms for incorporating changes
from remote repositories into a local repository.</p>

<p>The <strong>working tree</strong> (or directory) is the tree of files you are working
on in the current directory. In the example above, we started with this
working tree:</p>

<pre><code>proj1
├── code
│   ├── analysis.py
│   ├── eda.py
│   └── preprocess.py
├── data
│   └── blob.dat
├── figs
│   └── diagram.png
├── paper
│   ├── Makefile
│   ├── report.bib
│   └── report.tex
└── slides
    └── presentation.md
</code></pre>

<p>A <strong>commit</strong> is a <em>snapshot</em> of an entire directory tree at a given
point in time, some metadata (e.g., reference to previous commits,
authors name), and an identifier (this is called a hash and will be
discussed below). Returning to the above example, you would make a
<strong>commit</strong> corresponding to the original state of the directory tree,
which I listed. Committing the directory tree as listed above will allow
us to return to this exact state later (by <strong>checking out</strong> that
commit---as we will see---the working tree changed to contain exactly
the files and directories that we originally committed).</p>

<p>A <strong>repository</strong> is essentially a group of <em>linked</em> commits, which form
a directed acyclic graph (DAG), as well as a set of references to
specific commits (we refer to these references to commits as <strong>heads</strong>).
As part of the metadata of each commit, we include references to 0 or
more parent commits. The initial commit of each repository has 0
parents. Each subsequent commit is proceeded by 1 or more commits.</p>

<p><a href="/Users/wilsoncai/Dropbox/%40UCB/Courses/2016%20Spring/Big%20data_Lexin/7_tutorial-git-basics/figs/threecommits.png" target="_blank"><img src="/Users/wilsoncai/Dropbox/%40UCB/Courses/2016%20Spring/Big%20data_Lexin/7_tutorial-git-basics/figs/threecommits.png" alt="This is a schematic representation of three commits in a linear
workflow. The first commit `98ca9..` has no parents and Snapshot A

corresponding to the new state of the working tree. This new commit
`34ac2..` has one parent `98ca9..`, which it points to. Continuing in
this manner, a new commit `f30ab..` is made on top of the second commit
`34ac2..`." style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>

<p>Again returning to our example, the initial <strong>commit</strong> might correspond
to the the original state of the directory tree. Then when you begin
implementing your new analysis method, you don't need to make any copies
of the previous files (i.e., there is no need to execute
<code>cp analysis.py analysis.py.orig</code>). Since they are already committed,
you can always access the original state of the repository by checking
out the original commit. To proceed you would simply make the necessary
edits to the files in your directory tree and then when you are
satisfied with your changes you make a new commit. This new commit will
correspond to a snapshot of the entire directory tree with all the edits
you've made to it since the original commit. To keep track of the
history of the project, the new commit will include a reference to the
original commit as its parent. Now when your advisor suggests the
alternative analysis, you could checkout the original commit, implement
the new method, and commit your changes including a reference to the
original commit as its sole parent.</p>

<p>Finally, we need to understand how Git keeps track of commits. To
reference a commit, Git uses a <strong>hash</strong>. Hashing provides a way to have
a fixed-length identifier for a given set of information, such as a file
or set of files. The identifier is not guaranteed to be unique, but
under normal circumstances, it will always be unique.</p>

<p>To make this concrete, consider the following toy "implementation" in R:</p>

<pre><code>library('digest')

# first commit
data1 &lt;- 'This is the start of my paper.'
meta1 &lt;- 'date: 8/20/15'
hash1 &lt;- digest(c(data1, meta1), algo="sha1")

# second commit, linked to the first
data2 &lt;- 'Some more text in my paper...'
meta2 &lt;- 'date: 8/20/15'
# Note we add the parent hash here!
hash2 &lt;- digest(c(data2, meta2, hash1), algo="sha1")
</code></pre>

<p>The first hash is a cryptographic signature of the content of the commit
(<code>data1</code>) and its metadata (<code>meta1</code>). Since this is the first commit to
the repository, there is no parent commit that proceeds it. However, the
second hash is a cryptographic signature of the content of the commit
(<code>data2</code>) and its metadata (<code>meta2</code>) and---importantly---the first hash
(<code>hash1</code>).</p>

<p>And here it is in Python:</p>

<pre><code>import sha

# first commit
data1 = 'This is the start of my paper.'
meta1 = 'date: 8/20/15'
hash1 = sha.sha(data1 + meta1).hexdigest()

# second commit, linked to the first
data2 = 'Some more text in my paper...'
meta2 = 'date: 8/20/15'
# Note we add the parent hash here!
hash2 = sha.sha(data2 + meta2 + hash1).hexdigest()
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we have developed some basic vocabulary, let's start using Git.
To begin, we will use Git in the simplest way possible---as a
single-user working linearly with no remotes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>note</strong></p>

<p>If you haven't done so already, you will want to configure Git before
proceeding. You will want to do something like the following from your
Bash shell:</p>

<pre><code>$ git config --global user.name "Jarrod Millman"
$ git config --global user.email "millman@berkeley.edu"
$ git config --global core.editor /usr/bin/gedit
</code></pre>

<p>The first two lines tell Git who you are (obviously you should use
your own name and email address rather than mine). The final command
tells Git which text editor you wish to use. You should use whatever
text editor you prefer. For instance, I use <code>/usr/bin/vim</code>. The most
popular text editors on Linux are <code>vim</code> and <code>emacs</code>. If you aren't
familiar with them at this point, you will probably want to use a
simple text editor like <code>gedit</code>, which should already be installed on
your BCE VM. You can learn more about <code>gedit</code> here:

<p>From a Bash shell, type <code>git</code> (or <code>git help</code>) to see a list of the
'core' commands, which will look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ git
usage: git &lt;command&gt; [&lt;args&gt;]

The most commonly used git commands are:
   add        Add file contents to the index
   config     Get and set options
   clone      Clone a repository
   commit     Record changes to the repository
   init       Create an empty Git repository
   log        Show commit logs
   push       Update remote 
   status     Show the working tree status
</code></pre>

<p>You will see more commands than this, but these are the ones we cover in
the remainder of this tutorial.</p>

<p>There are two ways to get a repository. First you can <code>clone</code> an
existing repository. Second you can create a new one.</p>

<p>In this section, you will see how to create a new empty repository, add
content, and commit your work to repository. You will also see how to
look at a log of what you've done, see what you've changed, as well as
delete and rename files.</p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-git-init-create-an-empty-repository" class="anchor" href="#git-init-create-an-empty-repository" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><code>git init</code>: create an empty repository</h3>

<p>First create an empty repository using the <code>init</code> command:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd ~/src
$ git init demo
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I am working in my <code>~/src</code> directory. It is common to use a
specific directory for all your local repositories. I tend to use <code>src</code>,
but you might use <code>code</code>, <code>vc</code>, <code>work</code>, or something similar.</p>

<p>Let's look at what git did:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd demo
$ ls -la
$ ls -l .git
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>git init demo</code> command should have created a new directory called
<code>demo</code> in your <code>~/src</code> directory. Inside <code>~/src/demo</code> you will see
another directory <code>.git</code>. The <code>.git</code> directory is where git stores the
repository. Every time you stage some work or commit it, a snapshot of
your working tree is stored in the <code>.git</code> directory. You should avoid
modifying this directory manually. Since all the repository information
is stored in the <code>.git</code> directory, you can turn your working tree back
into a normal directory tree by deleting the <code>.git</code> directory.</p>

<p>Now let's edit our first file in the test directory with a text editor.
I'm doing it programmatically here for automation purposes, but you'd
normally be editing by hand:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo "My first bit of text" &gt; file1.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can tell git about this new file using the <code>add</code> command:</p>

<pre><code>$ git add file1.txt
</code></pre>

<p>We can now ask git about what happened with <code>status</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ git status
</code></pre>

<p>You should now see that <code>file1.txt</code> has been added to the staging area
and is ready to be committed.</p>

<p>Now we are ready to commit our changes:</p>

<pre><code>$ git commit -m "This is our first commit"
</code></pre>

<p>In the commit above, we used the <code>-m</code> flag to specify a message at the
command line. If we don't do that, git will open the editor we specified
in our configuration above and require that we enter a message. By
default, git refuses to record changes that don't have a message to go
along with them (though you can obviously 'cheat' by using an empty or
meaningless string: git only tries to facilitate best practices, it's
not your nanny).</p>

<p>While many people use the <code>-m</code> flag routinely, I would recommend
configuring your editor and then using it to add your commit message.
This has the advantage that while you are writing your commit message,
you can see the list of files that you are committing. While this may
seem inconsequential, I've found that this practice is helpful and
doesn't slow me down.</p>

<p>Let's do a little bit more work. Again, in practice you'll be editing
the files by hand, here we do it via shell commands for the sake of
automation (and therefore the reproducibility of this tutorial!)</p>

<pre><code>$ echo "And now some more text..." &gt;&gt; file1.txt
</code></pre>

<p>And now we can ask git what is different:</p>

<pre><code>$ git diff
</code></pre>

<pre><code>$ echo "Great progress ..." &gt;&gt; file1.txt
$ git add file1.txt
$ git commit -m "Great progress on this matter."
</code></pre>

<p>While the basic pattern is <em>work, add, commit, and repeat</em>, I tend to
repeatedly add my work to the staging area before I finally commit it.
This allows me to effectively keep saving my work, but only committing
it once I have finished and tested a chunk of work. The importance of
keeping track of your changes is not because you want to track the
possibly circuitous route you happened to take while implementing a new
feature in your code or revising your text. Rather, the goal is to track
the logical and conceptual steps that led to your new feature or
revision. As you learn more about git, you will learn how to rebase your
changes on a new history, to rewrite your history, as well as how to
break your commits into many commits. These features allow you to
carefully construct the history of your changes into a comprehensible
account that leads the reader of your history to an understanding of
what you have done. This makes it easier for you to understand what
you've done when you try to figure it out months later. It also makes it
easier for your collaborators to understand what you've done.</p>

<p>Understanding the difference between the working tree, the staging area
(or index), and the repository can be confusing at first. The <em>working
tree</em> or <em>working directory</em> is your local directory on the filesystem.
The staging area (or <em>index</em>) reflects your <code>git add</code>, <code>git rm</code>, etc.
changes that have been staged but not committed. The repository reflects
your commits.</p>

<p>Consider the schematic representation below. You work in your working
tree (or directory). Periodically, as you complete little chunks of
work, you add your work to the staging area. (Generally, speaking a
staging area is a place where you prepare to do something. For instance,
if you wish to go on a hike in the East Bay Regional Park system with
some of your friends, you could meet in a staging area---a parking lot
beside an entrance to one of the paths. The purpose of the staging area
in this instance is to provide a place where you and your friends can
coordinate before beginning your walk.) Once you've got a logical chunk
of work completed and staged, you can then commit it. Each commit has a
unique hash. You can go back to the exact snapshot of your working tree
at the time you committed it by checking it out using the <code>git checkout</code>
command, which we will discuss below.</p>



<h3>
<a id="user-content-git-log-revisited" class="anchor" href="#git-log-revisited" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><code>git log</code> revisited</h3>

<p>First, let's see what the log shows us now:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log
</code></pre>

<p>Sometimes it's handy to see a very summarized version of the log:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log --oneline --topo-order --graph
</code></pre>

<p>Git supports <em>aliases:</em> new names given to command combinations. Let's
make this handy shortlog an alias, so we only have to type <code>git slog</code>
and see this compact log:</p>

<pre><code># We create our alias (this saves it in git's permanent configuration file):
$ git config --global alias.slog "log --oneline --topo-order --graph"
# And now we can use it git slog
</code></pre>

<p>While <code>git add</code> is used to add files to the list git tracks, we must
also tell it if we want their names to change or for it to stop tracking
them. In familiar Unix fashion, the <code>mv</code> and <code>rm</code> git commands do
precisely this:</p>

<pre><code>$ git mv file1.txt file-newname.txt
$ git status
</code></pre>

<p>Note that these changes must be committed too, to become permanent! In
git's world, until something hasn't been committed, it isn't permanently
recorded anywhere:</p>

<pre><code>$ git commit -m "I like this new name better"
$ git slog
</code></pre>

<p>And <code>git rm</code> works in a similar fashion.</p>

<p>To understand what a Git <strong>branch</strong> is, we first need to revisit the
idea of a <strong>head</strong>. As discussed above, Git labels every commit with
cryptographic signature called a hash. These hashes can be considered to
uniquely identify every commit and are used to verify that the contents
of the commit and history of the commit are correct. While there are
many advantages to using these hashes to label the commits, it is
unlikely that you will remember these hashes. This is where heads come
into play. A head is an easy to remember label (e.g., <code>HEAD</code>, <code>master</code>,
<code>feature1</code>) that references a commit.</p>

<p><a href="/Users/wilsoncai/Dropbox/%40UCB/Courses/2016%20Spring/Big%20data_Lexin/7_tutorial-git-basics/figs/masterbranch.png" target="_blank"><img src="/Users/wilsoncai/Dropbox/%40UCB/Courses/2016%20Spring/Big%20data_Lexin/7_tutorial-git-basics/figs/masterbranch.png" alt="By default every repository has a head called `master`. In this figure
`master` refers to the commit whose has begins `f30ab`. This allows you
to refer to the commit by the easy to remember name `master` rather than
`f30ab`." style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>

<p>Credit: ProGit book, by Scott Chacon, CC License.</p>

<p>A repository can contain any number of heads. At any point in time, your
current working tree will correspond to a specific commit. By
convention, we refer to this commit with the name <code>HEAD</code> (note the use
of all capital letters to distinguish this from the generic notion of
head).</p>

<p>In Git, the notions of branch and head are essentially identical. Each
branch is associated with exactly one head and each head corresponds to
one branch. However, we use the term head to refer exclusively to a
label on exactly one commit; while the term branch may also sometimes be
used to refer not only to the commit labeled by the head but that commit
and all the commits that proceed it in the repository.</p>

<p><a href="/Users/wilsoncai/Dropbox/%40UCB/Courses/2016%20Spring/Big%20data_Lexin/7_tutorial-git-basics/figs/HEAD_testing.png" target="_blank"><img src="/Users/wilsoncai/Dropbox/%40UCB/Courses/2016%20Spring/Big%20data_Lexin/7_tutorial-git-basics/figs/HEAD_testing.png" alt="In this example there are two heads or branches, *master* and
*testing*, and *testing* is the currently active branch since it's what
*HEAD* points to." style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>

<p>Credit: ProGit book, by Scott Chacon, CC License.</p>

<p>Once new commits are made on a branch, HEAD and the branch label move
with the new commits:</p>

<p><a href="/Users/wilsoncai/Dropbox/%40UCB/Courses/2016%20Spring/Big%20data_Lexin/7_tutorial-git-basics/figs/branchcommit.png" target="_blank"><img src="/Users/wilsoncai/Dropbox/%40UCB/Courses/2016%20Spring/Big%20data_Lexin/7_tutorial-git-basics/figs/branchcommit.png" alt="In this example (notice that HEAD is not shown), the branch master and
iss53 share a common history up to commit C2. However, the branch iss53
differs from master as it has the additional commit
C3." style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>

<p>Credit: ProGit book, by Scott Chacon, CC License.</p>

<p>This allows the history of both branches to diverge. For instance, your
master branch may be were you integrate new features and bug fixes into
the main trunk of development. If you have a bug report (perhaps labeled
issue 53) that you are trying to fix, you might create a branch (labeled
iss53). While you are preparing a fix for issue 53, the main trunk gains
another bug fix or feature.</p>

<p><a href="/Users/wilsoncai/Dropbox/%40UCB/Courses/2016%20Spring/Big%20data_Lexin/7_tutorial-git-basics/figs/mergescenario.png" target="_blank"><img src="/Users/wilsoncai/Dropbox/%40UCB/Courses/2016%20Spring/Big%20data_Lexin/7_tutorial-git-basics/figs/mergescenario.png" alt="Here both master and iss53 have a shared history up to the commit C2.
However they both have commits that the other lacks after their shared
ancestor." style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>

<p>Credit: ProGit book, by Scott Chacon, CC License.</p>

<p>Once you've completed fixing issue 53 on branch iss53, you want to
integrate your work back into the main trunk represented by the master
branch. The process of integrating your work is called merging and often
happens automatically. Once the iss53 branch has been merged back into
the master branch, you can continue with a unified line of development:</p>

<p><a href="/Users/wilsoncai/Dropbox/%40UCB/Courses/2016%20Spring/Big%20data_Lexin/7_tutorial-git-basics/figs/mergeaftermath.png" target="_blank"><img src="/Users/wilsoncai/Dropbox/%40UCB/Courses/2016%20Spring/Big%20data_Lexin/7_tutorial-git-basics/figs/mergeaftermath.png" alt="The result of merging the iss53 branch into the master branch.

point, you could safely delete the iss53 branch, which would result in
removing the label iss53 pointing to commit C5. Credit: ProGit book, by

<p>Let's now illustrate all of this with a concrete example. Let's get our
bearings first:</p>

<pre><code>$ git status
$ ls
</code></pre>

<p>We are now going to try two different routes of development: on the
<code>master</code> branch we will add one file and on the <code>experiment</code> branch,
which we will create, we will add a different one. We will then merge
the experimental branch into <code>master</code>.</p>

<p>Create and work on an experimental branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ git branch experiment
$ git checkout experiment
$ echo "Some crazy idea" &gt; experiment.txt
$ git add experiment.txt
$ git commit -m "Trying something new"
$ git slog
</code></pre>

<p>Work on the master branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout master
$ git slog
$ echo "Work goes on in master..." &gt;&gt; file-newname.txt
$ git add file-newname.txt
$ git commit -m "The mainline keeps moving"
$ git slog
</code></pre>

<p>Now merge experimental branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls
$ git merge experiment
$ git slog
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>note</strong></p>

<p>We've seen that Git has multiple ways for referring to a commit.</p>

<ol>
<li> Using the full hash, which you can find using <code>git log</code>
</li>
<li> Using the first few characters of the hash (as long as there is no
ambiguity)</li>
<li> Using a head label (e.g., <code>HEAD</code> or <code>master</code>)</li>

<p>We are now going to introduce the concept of a <strong>remote</strong> repository: a
pointer to another copy of the repository that lives on a different
location. This can be simply a different path on the filesystem or a
server on the internet.</p>

<p>For this discussion, we'll be using remotes hosted on the
<a href="http://github.com">GitHub.com</a> service, but you can equally use other
services like <a href="http://bitbucket.org">BitBucket</a> or
<a href="http://gitorious.org">Gitorious</a> as well as host your own.</p>

<pre><code>$ git remote -v
</code></pre>

<p>Since the above cell didn't produce any output after the <code>git remote -v</code>
call, it means we have no remote repositories configured. We will now
proceed to do so.</p>

<p>Once logged into GitHub, go to the <a href="https://github.com/new">new repository
page</a> and make a repository called <code>test</code>. Do
<strong>not</strong> check the box that says
<code>Initialize this repository with a README</code>, since we already have an
existing repository here. That option is useful when you're starting
first at GitHub and don't have a repository made already on a local
computer.</p>

<p>We can now follow the instructions from the next page:</p>

<pre><code>$ git remote add origin git@github.com:wilsoncai1992/TESTGIT.git
$ git push -u origin master
</code></pre>

<p>Let's see the remote situation again:</p>

<pre><code>$ git remote -v
</code></pre>

<p>We can now <a href="https://github.com/wilsoncai1992/TESTGIT">see this repository publicly on
GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Let's see how this can be useful for backup and syncing work between two
different computers. I'll simulate a 2nd computer by working in a
different directory...</p>

<pre><code>$ cd ~/src/
</code></pre>

<p>Here I clone my 'test' repository but with a different name, TESTGIT2, to
simulate a 2nd computer:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone git@github.com:wilsoncai1992/TESTGIT.git TESTGIT2
$ cd TESTGIT2
$ pwd
$ git remote -v
</code></pre>

<p>Let's now make some changes in one 'computer' and synchronize them on
the second.</p>

<p>First I switch directories to simulate working on computer #2:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd ~/src/TESTGIT2
$ echo "More new content on my experiment" &gt;&gt; experiment.txt
$ git add experiment.txt
$ git commit -m "More work, on machine #2"
</code></pre>

<p>Now we put this new work up on the GitHub server so it's available from
the internet:</p>

<pre><code>$ git push
</code></pre>

<p>Now let's fetch that work from machine #1. Again, I first change
directories to simulate working from my other machine:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd ~/src/demo
$ git pull
</code></pre>

<p>While git is very good at merging, if two different branches modify the
same file in the same location, it simply can't decide which change
should prevail. At that point, human intervention is necessary to make
the decision. Git will help you by marking the location in the file that
has a problem, but it's up to you to resolve the conflict. Let's see how
that works by intentionally creating a conflict.</p>

<p>We start by creating a branch and making a change to our experiment
file:</p>

<pre><code>$ git branch trouble
$ git checkout trouble
$ echo "This is going to be a problem..." &gt;&gt; experiment.txt
$ git add experiment.txt
$ git commit -m "Changes in the trouble branch"
</code></pre>

<p>And now we go back to the master branch, where we change the <em>same</em>
file:</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout master
$ echo "More work on the master branch..." &gt;&gt; experiment.txt
$ git add experiment.txt
$ git commit -m "Mainline work"``
</code></pre>

<p>So now let's see what happens if we try to merge the <code>trouble</code> branch
into <code>master</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ git merge trouble
</code></pre>

<p>Let's see what git has put into our file:</p>

<pre><code>$ cat experiment.txt
Some crazy idea
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
More work on the master branch...
=======
This is going to be a problem...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; trouble
</code></pre>

<p>At this point, we go into the file with a text editor, decide which
changes to keep, and make a new commit that records our decision. To
automate my edits, I use the <code>sed</code> command:</p>

<pre><code>$ sed -i '/^&lt;/d' experiment.txt
$ sed -i '/^&gt;/d' experiment.txt
$ sed -i '/^=/d' experiment.txt
</code></pre>

<p>I've now made the edits, in this case I decided that both pieces of text
were useful, so I just accepted both additions:</p>

<pre><code>$ cat experiment.txt
Some crazy idea
More work on the master branch...
This is going to be a problem..
</code></pre>

<p>Let's then make our new commit:</p>

<pre><code>$ git add experiment.txt
$ git commit -m "Completed merge of trouble, fixing conflicts along the way"
$ git slog
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>note</strong></p>

<p>While it's a good idea to understand the basics of fixing merge
conflicts by hand, in some cases you may find the use of an automated
tool useful. Git supports multiple <a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-mergetool.html">merge
tools</a>:
a merge tool is a piece of software that conforms to a basic interface
and knows how to merge two files into a new one. Since these are
typically graphical tools, there are various to choose from for the
different operating systems, and as long as they obey a basic command
structure, git can work with any of them.</p>

<a id="user-content-exercise-single-remote-with-shared-access" class="anchor" href="#exercise-single-remote-with-shared-access" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Exercise: Single remote with shared access</h3>

<p>For this exercise, you are going to set up a shared collaboration with
one partner (the person sitting next to you). This will show the basic
workflow of collaborating on a project with a small team where everyone
has write privileges to the same repository.</p>

<p>We will have two people, let’s call them Alice and Bob, sharing a
repository. Alice will be the owner of the repository and she will give
Bob write privileges.</p>

<p>We begin with a simple synchronization example, much like we just did
above, but now between two people instead of one person. Otherwise it’s
the same:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Bob clones Alice's repository.</li>
<li>  Bob makes changes to a file and commits them locally.</li>
<li>  Bob pushes his changes to GitHub.</li>
<li>  Alice pulls Bob's changes into her own repository.</li>
</ul>

<p>Next, we will have both parties make non-conflicting changes each, and
commit them locally. Then both try to push their changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Alice adds a new file, <code>alice.txt</code> to the repository and commits.</li>
<li>  Bob adds <code>bob.txt</code> and commits.</li>
<li>  Alice pushes to GitHub.</li>
<li>  Bob tries to push to GitHub.</li>
</ul>

<p>What happened? Read the error message and hint provided by git to see if
you can figure it out.</p>

<p>Since Alice and Bob are working on the same branch of the repository,
the problem is that Bob's branch doesn't have Alice's most recent
commit, which the branch on GitHub has since Alice pushed it already. In
order to push a branch to a remote, you have to already have the entire
history on the remote in your local repository. The solution is for Bob
to first pull the changes (pull in git is really fetch+merge), and then
push again. When Bob pulls from his GitHub remote, he will merge Alice's
history into his repository. Now when he attempts to push, his
repository contains all the history that the remote repository on GitHub
has.</p>
